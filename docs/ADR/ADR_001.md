# ADR-001: Use of noobaa / multi-cloud gateway as a consistent object storage interface

## Context and Problem Statement

The data science workflows that are used within OpenShift AI are dependent on object storage, based on the S3 protocol.
While object storage / blob is wide spread, interfaces for provisioning are inconsistent.
In order to automate the provisioning lifecycle of data science projects within the pattern it is essential that the pattern, via argoCD and helm charts, can orchestrate the provisioning lifecycle.
The second question is to ensure that the data scientists don't need to directly understand the underlying storage infrastructure, including for application development.

## Considered Options

### Depend exclusively on external object storage

#### Positives

- No infastructure consumption for storage on cluster.
-

#### Negatives

- Requires credential management and access to s3 in the cloud account with appropriate IAM credentials.
- S3 is not a given in on-premise environment

### Leverage object storage via an internal platform exclusively using minio

#### Positives

- Consistent addressing for object storage in cluster for application development
- Closed loop credential management easing automation

#### Negatives

- Always consumes expensive (block) storage
- Additional vendor required for commercial support
- Minio operator is not currently supported on 4.15
- Multi-cluster setups must be cluster aware

### Leverage Noobaa (Multi cloud gateway) to provide a flexible interface

#### Positives

- Flexible choice between using in cluster and out of cluster storage
- Multi-cluster setups can obfuscate origin of s3 across multiple sites
- Clear support path for downstream development

#### Negatives

- Flexibility provides choice but also increases required parameters, documentation and instrumentation

## Decision Outcome

Use Noobaa / MCG as:

1. It worked out of the box easily
1. There is a clear support path.
